        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>I was born in Canada in 2006, I've lived in Toronto for all of my life. I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and coding. Right now I have been watching The Sopranos and I am currently on Season 4, nearing the end of it. I really hope that this class will teach me information that will help me forward in my career as a programer. Below will be some of the courses I will be taking this semester:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating Systems.</li>
            <li>Fundamentals of Javascript.</li>
            <li>Web Programing and Design</li>
        </ul>
